# Expected workflows
## User account/profile creation
Users will provide their own profile information. Send them the link, skillset.tomgt.org, and they will create an account on the login page. Upon first login, they will be prompted to provide profile information.
User accounts are created with an email that serves as a unique identifier, so primary emails cannot be changed. Other emails, however can be added to the profile if desired.
In the Admin page (accessible by the Menu icon in the nav bar), user profiles can be edited manually by admins, or users can edit their own information when viewing their own profile.

## Activity/Subsection creation
Skillset activities are set up as a sequence of subsections. Subsections can be created and edited from the Admin page, and can include images/text/code blocks etc. When creating/editing an subsection, it can be assigned to a certain activity. Subsections can have the option of requiring a deliverable to be submitted.
When editing activities, subsections can be added and reordered into a desired sequence.

## Reviewing submissions
Each user has the ability to review/download/delete their own submissions on the 'Review Submissions' page accessibly through the menu in the nav bar. Admins have access to a second tab on this same page that gives a fourth option to review - to approve or reject with feedback.
